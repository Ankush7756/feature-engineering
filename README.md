Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is the process of creating new features (or predictors/variables) from existing data to improve the performance of machine learning models. It is a crucial step in the data science pipeline as the quality of the features used to train a model can greatly affect its accuracy and generalizability.

This repository provides a collection of feature engineering techniques commonly used in data science projects. It includes code examples in various programming languages such as Python and R, as well as explanations and visualizations to help users understand the underlying concepts.
